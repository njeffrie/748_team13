Flooding TDMA is a flash flooding based TDMA protocol which exploits the
low latency of flash flooding across a multi-hop network.  Flooding TDMA
assigns each leaf node a time slot, and calculates the minimum network 
necessary to propagate sensor values from the leaf node to the root node.

Setup for flooding TDMA requires each node in the network to have a unique ID
counting from 1 to the number of nodes.  After a time reset followed by a 
synchronization pulse, Each node floods the network during its time interval 
based on node ID.  Packets forwarded across the network during this first 
flood have the following structure:
{ hop count, orig_sender, first_re-transmitter, second re-transmitter, ... } 
By default the length of the packet is limited to 8 bytes, so network is 
limited to 7 hops

The second phase of startup has the root node transmit the shortest path
to each leaf node during the leaf node's time slot.  In this way, nodes
along the shortest path from root to leaf node (and therefore on the shortest
path from leaf to root) know they must be listening and waitint to retransmit
during that particular leaf node's time slot

Once startup is over, each node will have a table with one entry per timeslot.
Each entry indicated whether the node can be off, listening or transmitting.
This structure allows for future modications and extensions to the network
routing protocol.
